# Networks urbanism course

The course is structured around the topic of network literacy and its applications in urbanism and architecture. The course is based on materials from the course which I made with my colleague from CRI (Paris) and materials we prepared with network scientists on a network literacy book.      

# Skills you will learn and train during the course 

Theoretical foundations of network theory applied to the context of urban data Practical knowledge of how to use some network concepts in urban context  Basic knowledge how to create data science project related to the city analysis Basic coding skills (depending on your level of programming knowledge).  Using open science framework github.com  3D printing techniques for networks (additional if relevant)
